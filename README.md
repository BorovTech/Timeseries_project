# Timeseries_project
DSBA 2nd course project

This repository is dedicated to the research on the topic "Chaotic Time Series Prediction", with the main focus on financial series (stock prices). The goal of our research was to predict the point of trend reversal by finding out whether there exist such sequences of points that foreshadow the trend reversal.
